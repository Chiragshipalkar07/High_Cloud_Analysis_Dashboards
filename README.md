# High Clouds Airline Analysis

This project is an **Airline Data Analysis** case study designed as part of a Data Analysis / Data Visualization course. The objective is to explore airline performance, passenger load factors, and travel patterns using Excel and Power BI dashboards.

# Project Overview
Airline industries generate vast amounts of data related to flights, routes, passengers, and carriers.
This project analyzes flight datasets to uncover insights about:
• Number of airlines and carriers worldwide
• Flight distributions based on distance groups
• Load factor trends (weekdays vs. weekends, yearly trends)
• Top airline carriers and their market share
• Top flight routes based on passenger volume

Two interactive dashboards were created:
1. Power BI Dashboard – For advanced interactivity and KPI tracking
2. Excel Dashboard – For comparative visualization and pivot-based insights

# Tools & Technologies
• Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation
• Power BI: DAX, data modeling, and interactive dashboard design
• Data Source: Airline dataset (Kaggle / provided course dataset)

# Power BI Dashboard
• KPIs: Total Airlines, Carrier Names, Countries, States
• Flight distribution by "distance interval"
• % of Load Factor by Carrier Name
• Load Factor "Weekend vs. Weekday" (Pie chart)
• "Top 10 routes" (From–To city) based on flights
• Yearly trend analysis of Load Factor

# Excel Dashboard
• Total Airlines count
• Available seats vs. transported passengers
• Carrier market share (Pie chart)
• Top 10 carrier names by passenger preference
• Load Factor comparison (Weekdays vs. Weekends)
• Flights grouped by distance

# Insights
• "Short-haul flights (<500 miles)" dominate the dataset.
• "Weekdays" see higher load factors compared to weekends.
• A few carriers account for the "majority of passengers", while many airlines have minimal shares.
• "Top routes" are concentrated between major business hubs (e.g., Chicago, Washington, Atlanta).
• The yearly load factor shows "steady growth" over time with fluctuations in certain years.

# Future Improvements
• Add passenger demographic segmentation (age, class, purpose of travel).
• Forecast demand trends using Power BI predictive models.
• Automate Excel data refresh with Power Query.
• Include interactive filters for "aircraft type" and "region-wise" breakdown.

# Learning Outcomes
• Hands-on experience in Excel Dashboarding and Power BI reporting.
• Strong understanding of data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling.
• Ability to derive business insights from raw airline datasets
